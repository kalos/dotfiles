known_hosts:
Only host 'jiji' have the permission (on syncthing) to update/write this file.

Other host write to file known_hosts2 and use known_hosts as GlobalKnownHostsFile.
Example: 
Host *
  UserKnownHostsFile ~/.ssh/known_hosts2
  GlobalKnownHostsFile ~/.ssh/known_hosts

This instruct ssh and fish host completion (func __fish_print_hostnames) to use both files.
